rotationsensor
==============

A sensor using capacitive coupling and step response to measure rotation

positionsensor.c is written to run in an ATtiny44 microcontroller chip.   

makefile is the command to create the binary to load into the chip.

sensor.html is the script we used to visualize what values we could expect 
to get from our sensor.
